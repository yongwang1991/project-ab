with st.expander("Implementation Details"):
    st.write("1. Enter your prompt in the text area. For example, enter the following: Draft the specifications for establishing a 3 years period contract for purchasing movie tickets.")
    st.write("2. Click the 'Submit' button.")
    st.write("3. The app will first generate the list of main sections based on your prompt.")
    st.write("4. If the generated specifications require improvements, add a liner or two to try again. For example, enter the following prompt: Remove the last section.")
    st.write("5. Once you are happy with the main sections, the app will start developing the draft of the Requirements Specifications section by section.")
    st.write("6. You may iterate with the app to refine the drafts of each section. Once you are happy, the draft section will be committed to the finalised version.")
    st.write("7. Once all the sections are completed, you may go to the 'Finalised' tab to extract the entire Requirements Specifications.")
